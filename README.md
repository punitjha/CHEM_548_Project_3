CHM 548 PROGRAMMING HOMEWORK 3

(1) Hückel for molecules: Write a general Hückel MO program applicable to the π electronic structures of polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules. 

(2) Hückel 1D band structure: Write a general one-dimensional Hückel band structure program and apply it to π bands of
polyacetylene and single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNT). Plot energy bands.

(3) Hückel 2D band structure: Write a general two-dimensional Hückel band calculation program and apply it to π bands of
graphene. Plot energy bands. The pioneering studies on graphene led to Nobel Prize in Physics in 2010 (Geim and Novoselov).

(4) SSH and Jahn–Teller theorem: Modify the Hückel program for PAH’s in Subproject 1 to include the effect of bond length
variations on both π and σ energies according to the Su–Schrieffer–Heeger model. Apply this program to benzene and benzene
cation and plot their energies (the sum of π and σ energies) as a function of symmetry breaking geometry changes. Discuss the
result in relation to the Jahn–Teller theorem.

(5) SSH and Peierls theorem: Modify the Hückel program for one-dimensional solids in Subproject 2 to include the effect of
bond length variations on the energy bands and total energy according to the SSH model. Apply this to polyacetylene and plot
the energy with respect to the bond length alternation.
